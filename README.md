## Description

AirBnB Clone is a web application developed as part of ALX group project by Ukpono Umoren and Alexander Udeogaranya. It aims to replicate the core functionalities of the popular online lodging marketplace, Airbnb.

## Project Overview

The AirBnB Clone project implements a custom command-line interface for data management, as well as the base classes for storing the data. It follows an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach and includes features such as serialization, deserialization, and a file storage engine.

## Getting Started

To get started with the AirBnB Clone project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Dr-dyrane/AirBnB_clone.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the console:

   ```
   python console.py
   ```

## Usage ðŸ’»

The AirBnB Clone console provides a command-line interface to manage the objects of the AirBnB project. You can create new objects, retrieve existing objects, perform operations on objects, update attributes, and destroy objects.

Refer to the console commands and syntax documentation for detailed usage instructions.
